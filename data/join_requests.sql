For a short while I also hosted my own small community with friends before having to cease due to real life time commitments. To put it shortly, I have quite a lot of Arma experience!

I like to think that the age old stereotype of pasty young men sitting at home all day is a bit silly and so I find the Arma community to be rather satisfyingly filled with great people. I enjoy anything that requires teamwork and cooperation, even in a competitive nature.  During my years at University I signed up to the UOTC which is effectively a training corps designed to take graduates into the reserves and spit out officers. This means I had a lot of time in greens and that directly translated to being more knowledgeable in my Arma sessions which in turn grew even more enjoyable. I\'m in the middle of a transfer of career over to being a junior software developer so I\'m looking forward to testing my new skills in Arma mission making, something I have always enjoyed.  I\'m not comfortable with putting any real personal information here, but I would be happy to have that conversation if I\'m accepted on a less formal note.  As to why I think I could contribute, I think I have a large amount of experience both in being a part of and leading Arma communities that seem to have similar directions to ARCOMM. I love to play with friends in this sort of environment and therefore I tend to find the fun in most situations. I have no interest in drama or politics and I keep my head when things get crazy in game. I would also be interested in seeing what I could do to help this community grow. <P>', 1),

I\'ve used some of the Steam created content like Pilgrimage and Dynamic Universal War System and so forth. <P>', 'I\'ve always played video games since I was young, it\'s something I\'ve always enjoyed. I like strategy games the most as I always love the amount of management that\'s involved as well as planning. I\'ve played games like Call of Duty when I was younger but never really cared for the lack of strategy involved in that type of shooter genre.    <P>\r\nThis brings me to my introduction into the Arma style of games.   When I was young I joined a friend of my father in a game called Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising. In this game they hosted wars where each team (I believe it was something like 100 VS 100) would fight for control of points and strategic objectives. That game played like Arma in a way but being that it was mostly adults, I couldn\'t really keep up; I was around 14 or so when I was played that. However, that game sparked an interest into the type of realistic shooter that I would find in Arma 3 later in my life now.     <P>\r\nThat being said, I recently remembered about groups such as yourselves that did co-op missions, along with other types. I\'ve played a few open servers and while it was fun, it was also not very managed on a player based level. I keep finding people that just try and be the average Rambo and kill everything, most of the time while putting the rest of us on the line for their few seconds of glory, before they are subsequently shot down by the few AI they set out to kill.    <P>\r\nI don\'t enjoy that kind of game play, I enjoy the realism of the combat and more importantly, I care about my other squad mates in and out of the combat. In that particular mission I played the ammo bearer; one of the seemingly worst roles to play to the average player, but my thoughts were of my team and their needs above my own. I\'ll be honest though, I even didn\'t enjoy that because no one asked my for anything.     <P>\r\nSo here I am, I\'m looking to be as useful to any of you as I can. I\'m looking for a group that I can be a team with and enjoy growing with, in a none serious and yet serious way. A group that is ready to play Arma 3 like it was meant to be played.    <P>\r\n(Sorry if this all seemed like a rant, I just have great passion for this game)    <P>\r\nThings I could contribute  to ARCOMM:  I will take on any role given to me as well as be flexible to role changes if need be.  I will do tasks that seem menial and or boring.  I will follow orders as closely as possible.  I will be professional throughout the whole experience, even in death.  I will be as active as I can to the Saturday events. (I add this because I\'m about to be married so there may be times that I\'m just not able)    <P>\r\nAs far as real world help:  I have and know how to use audio recording hardware and software, the equipment I have is worth around $2000 dollars. I\'m a singer/song writer as well and if need be can use my time towards a project in this group.    <P>\r\nPersonal:  I\'m 21 years old as of November 3, I\'m getting married on January 9th and work out of Plano TX in the Telecom industry.     <P>\r\nI hope that I can be apart of your group, I just wanted to give this a shot and see where it goes.

With SCOR my A team was just four elite operators and myself, we only helped 3 Arma-life servers but we mainly focused on perfecting and developing advanced small unit tactics. We only dealt with hostage situations, HVT capture/elimination, CSAR(combat search and rescue), high profile recon (gathering information on gangs/criminals/terrorists to plan a mission to capture or kill) and direct action raids meaning we did not respond to any call from any mods from any server unless the issue pertained to one of the listed issues. Before issues began arising with files we practiced and developed ASUT TTPs on a modified version of Fallujah in both A2 & A3, allowing us to focus completely on CQB, Urban warfare, insertion & extraction in dense cities and direct action raids in non-permissive environments that have unknown amount of hostiles that are surrounding the target area.

I am a busy person and all that simply takes too much time. I have better things to do. Like play the damn game. As the Civil Air Patrol teaches you when you first join "We will teach you how to be a leader. To be a good leader you must first become a follower." And I believe that wholeheartedly. I have zero issues taking orders and while it\'s not my favorite thing in the world I have been trained and have no problem giving them. Granted, I really have little experience in this environment and would not be the best choice. I\'ve never been one to have a problem getting along with others, and I understand that people are people and that this is just a game. We\'re all just here to have fun and it\'s more fun when you like the people you\'re playing with. Again, it\'s hard for me to say just how much I can contribute or help because I really don\'t know what I\'ll be faced with. But I\'m open for anything. Thank you for your time. <P>', 1),

Co-Op/Adversarial sessions with friends is why I game.    <P>\r\n One of the things that stood out to me most about arcomm is that you guys try to imitate the way ShackTac plays. I actually was a prior member of the group back in 2011 but went inactive a while ago due to time constraints. After a 3-year gaming hiatus i\'m back to playing ArmA, but unfortunately ST isn\'t taking on new members. I\'ve since been looking for a group that can replicate their almost perfect mix of tactical seriousness and hilarious fun. The problem for me was that most groups are either too serious, too casual, or strictly Co-op.     <P>\r\nSo, basically, I\'m excited to apply for this group. My past experience in ShackTac should mean that I should have no issues adjusting to the mentality/playstyle. In addition you\'ll be getting someone who\'s laidback, knows how to play tactically but also how to have a good time, as well as someone who can be your wingman or squadmate in other games outside of ArmA. I\'m not only looking for a commmunity to strictly play ArmA with - I\'m also hoping to find gamers with similar interests to play games we both enjoy.    <P>\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my application, I look forward to hearing back hopefully soon! <P>', 1),

I picked up Arma 3 when it came out and have played it off and on since then. Arma is one of my "comfort games." A term I use meaning you\'ll go play something else but always will come back and play your comfort games. As I mentioned I have only played on public servers as my schedule hasn\'t been steady enough for me to commit to an organized group. However a few month ago I got a new job which has solved that pro lwm and I\'m looking to get into some organized play.    <P>\r\nAny mod I have used for Arma was for Dayz as I haven\'t ever played except on public servers. Though I am experienced with mods in other games such as Kerbal Space Program. Also I know of many Arma mods, I just havnylt used any.  <P>', '*Warning. I wrote this on my phone. Any errors I apologize in advance*    <P>\r\nHello, I\'m Kracken, which is not just my online handle but my nickname as well. Over 6 years ago I joined the Air Force, (cue the chair force joke here) and everyone started calling me by my last name, McCracken. Well that was shortened rather quickly to Cracken and I then just wrote it with a K instead of a C. In the military I worked as an Avionics technician on the F-22. And though I am concidered a combat veteran, I don\'t because that place was a joke. I am now a civilian working out in the Phoenix, AZ area.    <P>\r\nI only mention my military past because it gave we two things, Firstly I try and act in a some what professional matter when it matters. If its a joking atmosphere then Ill joke around. I try and keep my cool and think logically about something and treat others with respect, until they are an asshole of course. Secondly, working in aircraft maintenance gives you a thick skin. If you don\'t have one already you will get one pretty quick, or you\'ll be gone jus as quickly. Unlike most Americans, very little really bothers me and I enjoy all kinds of humor and joking. And as for my sailor mouth, I had that before the military.    <P>\r\nAs far as gaming goes, I really enjoy the Co-op style of gameplay. Years and years ago I was a raider in World of Warcraft. I really enjoyed it, the idea of many people coming and working together for a common goal was awsome. Sadly that game devolved as well as the community. With my foremention schedule being hectic, I many sticked to a quicker style of co op games like Payday2, Destiny, Division, Nazis zombies, and more importantly Planetside 2.     <P>\r\nI say importantly because it was the closest analog to Arma. I joined a group, the 666th Devil Dogs, and loved the combined arms Ops we ran. Having 2 or 3 platoons of infantry with Armor and Air support and a QRF going all at once was very fun and tactical as it could be in that game enviroment. Using TS3 we used a whisper lost setup to keep in contact with the other divisions. It was about as close to a JTFR setup as we could make it. Since nobody wanted to squad lead, I had to step up and learn it all. Whether I was good at it is debatable but I know we had fun and in the end that\'s all that matters.    <P>\r\nWell I think that does. I feel I have rambled long enough. If you have any questions, clarification or want to chat feel free to hit me up. I thank you for your time and hope to hear from you. <P>', 1),

I work from home as a software developer and system admin for an Internet based company. No I won\'t fix your computer. My job gives me a lot of flexibility in scheduling activities in my life. I used to be a martial arts instructor and am certified to teach the handgun carry class in Oklahoma. I have never been in the military. I am not a police officer. I was raised in what in Oklahoma would be called "the sticks", but I don\'t know anything about farming or ranching. My parents just didn\'t like people.    <P>\r\nMy computer was built by me and has an i7-4802 3.7ghz processor with an R9 290 GPU. I have a headset with a working microphone and am familiar with and comfortable using Teamspeak. I have TrackIR and I am so happy that with Arma, unlike most FPSes, I can actually keep my head on a swivel.    <P>\r\nI am a former EVE Online player (w/ Tactical Narcotics Team and then Goonswarm Federation). Currently I am learning to fly a Huey in DCS World. I also play Elite:Dangerous because SPACESHIP!!!    <P>\r\nI purchased and played the The Division, but it turns out while I like guns, I hate grinding for loot. What I looked for in The Division was tactical play that also involved guns. I had discounted games like CoD as the story is mostly on rails and the PVP is nothing but unrealistic run-n-gun fests combined with jump spam. They included CoD like jump spam in "Space Jam", but took it out when Michael Jordan said, "Damn, not even cartoons could do that shit". When my son Coolwhip and I started playing the Cooperative missions in Insurgency I realized there were other FPS games besides CoD that actually supported team based tactical play I was looking for. I\'ve been looking for such a thing in all the wrong places. I\'ve played lots of RPG games that just turn out to be unrealistic slug fests (I stabbed you 100 times with this knife, how are you still alive???) with nothing more tactial than "don\'t stand in the red circle". When The Division failed to deliver what I was looking for, Coolwhip suggested we try Arma.    <P>\r\nDslyecxi has some fantastic Huey videos for DCS I had already consumed and I knew he was primarily an Arma player. I was entering in my Paypal info to buy Arma while watching one of his videos. Finally, that was the game I was looking for. Big open sandbox world (like EVE). Lots of tools in the sandbox to support play (planes, helos, boats, mission editing, terrain, etc.). And one last thing: Guns, lots of guns. But without taking away from the solo missions I\'ve seen, it is clear that the only way to play Arma is with human friends and not AI ones. Really all my favorite game experiences have come while playing with others, but experience tells me that joining public servers to PUG will result in me putting aside Arma in short order. You gotta make friends to have fun.    <P>\r\nMy goals in Arma are to learn, participate in, and eventually pass on to others tactical team play in a realistic environment. I\'d like to do that while also playing with friends who are fun to be around. I myself am agreeable to be around, although I am more a consumer of hijinks than I am a perpetrator. If I learn to land successfully, it would be super if I could also fly helicopters on group activities that require it. I have no idea why I\'m obsessed with helicopters instead of jets, but the heart wants what the heart wants.    <P>\r\nOther than a willing meatshield I\'m not sure about what specifically I can offer Arcomm. Obviously I have no in-game skills. What I do have is a willingness to learn while being relentlessly made fun of for sucking. I\'m married, so I\'m used to it trust me.    <P>\r\nOne last thing, and really the first thing, is Coolwhip. He\'s my son and a great kid, but he\'s 14yr old. As far as I know he has never claimed to have sex with anyones mother, nor claimed to be a MLGPRO-XXxx360NoScopexxXX, nor questioned the sexuality or racial heritage of anyone. He does however sometimes say "get rekt", but honestly who doesn\'t at least think that when they make a particularly good kill? I would know if he does these things, because his computer is right next to mine. I know your rules say 16yr old, but I can\'t leave him behind. Even if he couldn\'t formally join the group, but be allowed to play with Arcomm during less serious times that would be great.    <P>\r\nIn a former life I was a preacher and I know you said "The more you write the better", but I don\'t think you realize just how much longer I could go on here.

When pubbing, I tend to gravitate toward transport helicopters and reconnaissance because that\'s the easiest to do solo and I haven\'t found a solid core of individuals to group with.

I happened to meet a random guy in game at a barn just above cherno.  He was a rare person who wasn\'t trying to kill me on sight and instead wanted me to give him a blood transfusion so he could heal.  After agreeing we ended up running around together the rest of the night and stayed in contact after that.  Suddenly dayz got  a lot more fun playing with another person as you could use tactics and just overall nice to have someone watching your back.    <P>\r\nAt this point I had never even tried vanilla arma and had no idea what it was like.  My new friend mentioned that I should try playing "real arma" and that I might like it, and so we played on a few invade and annex servers and I saw quickly that vanilla arma could also be a lot of fun.  He also showed me shacktac videos from youtube and I quickly watched video after video, seemingly never able to get enough of the awesome gameplay I was seeing and wishing I could be a part of something like that.  After I tried playing in a few sessions with United Operations and found it to be a horrible experience due to leaders putting more emphasis on formations and yelling if you weren\'t making a perfect wedge we both ended up applying to join shacktac, and amazingly after a month or two of waiting we actually got replies and were accepted.    <P>\r\nAt this point you\'re probably thinking wtf am I doing applying here if I was accepted into shacktac.  Well shacktac was pretty amazing, just like the videos show.  They have huge sessions two nights a weeks that last several hours, and the vibe is very laid back and enjoyable.  The problem was that you need to be fairly active within the community and I guess I wasn\'t what they wanted.  I showed up for most sessions but I didn\'t post on the forums or say much in IRC as I\'m more of a lurker when it comes to that sort of thing.  Just my personality.  At some point I think my forum account had an issue with it and I couldn\'t log in, and I assumed I had been kicked for not being active enough.  This was also at a time where my motivation to play arma was dwindling and so I kind of just let it go instead of pursuing the problem and seeing if maybe it was just a stupid error.    <P>\r\nSo now here I am a few years later, looking to get back into arma.

I play Arma 3 and other games for two reasons: the first is to relax and escape, if only for a few hours, to somewhere else. So far, the virtual war zones of Altis and Stratis provide me a pleasant way to get lost in the Editor, limited by only my imagination and patience. and also during mission execution. The second reason I play is that I like games that tell stories. During my time learning to use the Editor, I\'ve realized that Arma 3 has the capacity to tell nearly infinite stories due to its scope and detail. The simple missions I\'ve thrown together so far pale in comparison to videos from groups like ShackTactical or Luetin09, for example.     <P>\r\nI would like to be engaged in better stories and moments. I\'ve also come to the conclusion that the best stories are told with other people involved. I\'ve never really been engaged with an online community like ARCOMM.

I had some issues with some of the ways it was run, mainly the use of half baked mods, third person use and exotic weapons/scopes/thermal.

As I\'ve gotten older I\'ve become more interested in sim games, grand strategy games and roguelikes. This is mainly because I\'ve grown tired of most AAA gaming experiences, so many games use the same mechanics to the point where if the story isn\'t interesting enough then it\'s almost not worth playing. So as of now I like to play stuff like Stellaris, XCOM, Kerbal Space Program, ARMA, Project Zomboid.     <P>\r\nOther than gaming, the only sport I play is golf, been playing that my whole life.     <P>\r\nOne of the reasons I decided to apply was the size. There seems to be a good number of people in the group, which usually bodes well for the survivability longterm in a unit. The other major reason is the structure of the group, the previous group I was in was a strict mil-sim that used the power structure in negative ways that become rather toxic in a very short amount of time. I\'ve had enough time with clans and guilds in WoW and previous games with the toxicitiy of grownups trying to grasp power over people in a game, so I look forward to a more flat structure where everyone respects one another and rank can\'t be pulled as a trump card.     <P>\r\nAlso, the optics you guys use. It\'s a small detail, but I really tried to get my previous group to consider ironsights/red dots only to make the missions more challenging and interesting in combat. So to see a group that shares the same ideals is a bonus (also 1st person only, can\'t stand third person peeking)     <P>\r\nAs for what I\'ll bring to the table? Well, I like to be near the front lines when possible, tip of the spear so to speak. I don\'t take brash moves that will get myself killed, but I tend to be more aggressive with my tactics in terms of flanking and maneuvers. During my time with my previous group I was a fireteam leader and squad leader from time to time.

However, I probably have 200-300 or more on Operation Flashpoint (on the xbox) and probably 100-200 more on ArmA 2, though for some reason it doesn\'t ever sync. Despite that, I\'m competent, and tend to play with difficulty/realism maxed out as much as possible. Though as I usually play single-player, getting the AI to cooperate properly is the main thing that keeps me from playing more. As far as mods go, I haven\'t gone for many that haven\'t added vehicles/weapons. I\'ve stayed away from multiplayer for the most part because I haven\'t really had anyone to play with, and my experience with randomly joining a server has been thus far unremarkable. <P>', 'Well, I\'m not really sure where to begin, or how entirely how effective an introduction through text is likely to be, but I\'ll certainly do my best. Before I get too far started I just want to say: I\'m in it for the fun. That\'s the most important part, much more so than winning.     <P>\r\nNow, one of the reasons I\'m not terribly a fan of the text-intro is that I\'m a bit of a joker, by which I mean a huge part of what I say when I don\'t have to be serious is intended to make someone laugh. I want to point out that I am definitely of the opinion that one should never dish out more than they\'re willing to take, but I usually start off small and aim any jabs (at other people) to the level of the last one they threw. As far as self-deprecation goes, well, I know I\'m not going to make me upset. That\'s fairly difficult to get across with a wall of text, and I\'m not really sure how believable /I\'d/ find the part where someone basically says "I\'m funny", but hey, improvise, adapt and overcome, right? So moving right along past my excellent start right there, I guess it\'s time for the short-life-story part.    <P>\r\nIt all started in a dark room some 22 years ago, but I\'ll just skip that part because I don\'t want to think about it for too long. Standard childhood, went to school, moved once, more school, graduated. College accepted, more school. That\'s pretty much where I\'m at right now. I\'m an Engineering major at a local college in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I work as a tutor for the same. I tutor math up to Diff Eq as well as Physics and Chemistry. Why does that matter? Because I set my own hours, and I\'m pretty well free for the evenings most of the time.    <P>\r\nSo what can I bring to ARCOMM? Well, mainly, just a guy lookin to have some \'serious fun\'. I\'m willing to be in whatever position is needed. Medic, rifleman, AR, pilot, whatever you need really. I can fly the helicopters/planes competently, but I\'ve recently acquired a joystick/pedal combo, so I\'m having to relearn that a bit. (My landings are currently sub par, but flight is pretty okay.) As far as leader-ing goes, I don\'t really want to say "Oh yeah, I\'ll be great", because commanding AI and commanding people that are capable of making their own decisions are two /very/ different animals. One of the things I\'d like to try my hand at, which I haven\'t had much real chance to do so far is a bit of mission-making, or Zeus-ing. After all, where\'s the surprise in a mission if you\'re the one who makes it?    <P>\r\nSo, in short, I\'m a guy who\'s here for \'serious fun\', and I\'m willing to take any role that doesn\'t require an audition on a black leather couch.    <P>\r\n <P>', 1),
